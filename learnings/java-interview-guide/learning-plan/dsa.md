### **Day 1â€“2: Arrays and String Problems**

#### **Key Concepts**
1. **Array Basics**: Understand how arrays work, their memory structure, and basic operations (insertion, deletion, traversal).
2. **String Manipulation**: Familiarize yourself with character arrays, immutability in Java, and basic operations (substring, concatenation, etc.).
3. **Two-Pointer Technique**: Often used in problems involving arrays or strings to reduce complexity from `O(n^2)` to `O(n)`.
4. **Sliding Window Technique**: Useful for problems requiring the examination of contiguous subarrays or substrings. It efficiently handles fixed and variable window sizes.
5. **Frequency Counting**: Important for problems that involve checking for duplicates, anagrams, or certain frequency conditions in arrays or strings.

#### **Important Problems and Concepts**

1. **Two-Pointer Problems**
   - The two-pointer technique is used when you need to find pairs in a sorted array or work with indices moving from opposite ends.
   - **Common Scenarios**: Pair sum, reverse a string or array in-place, and check for palindromic properties.

2. **Sliding Window Problems**
   - The sliding window approach is typically used for finding subarrays or substrings that meet specific conditions (e.g., longest/shortest subarray of a certain sum).
   - **Fixed-Window**: When the window size remains constant (e.g., finding the maximum sum subarray of a fixed size).
   - **Variable-Window**: When the window can expand or contract based on certain conditions (e.g., smallest subarray with a sum greater than a given number).

3. **Frequency Counting**
   - Frequency maps help solve problems like finding duplicates, anagrams, and longest substring with unique characters.
   - **Common Data Structures**: `HashMap` or `int[]` arrays for counting character occurrences.

### **Problems to Practice**

#### **Two-Pointer Technique**

1. **Pair Sum (Two Sum)**
   - **Problem**: Find two numbers in a sorted array that add up to a target sum.
   - **Example**: [LeetCode 1 - Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
   - **Approach**: Use two pointers at each end of the array and move towards each other based on the sum compared to the target.

2. **Reverse Words in a String**
   - **Problem**: Given an input string `s`, reverse the order of words.
   - **Example**: [LeetCode 151 - Reverse Words in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/)
   - **Approach**: Use pointers to trim spaces, then reverse each word, or reverse the entire string and then each word.

3. **Palindrome Check**
   - **Problem**: Determine if a given string is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.
   - **Example**: [LeetCode 125 - Valid Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/)
   - **Approach**: Use two pointers, one at the beginning and the other at the end, to compare characters.

4. **Move Zeros**
   - **Problem**: Move all zeros in an array to the end while maintaining the order of non-zero elements.
   - **Example**: [LeetCode 283 - Move Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/)
   - **Approach**: Use two pointers to move non-zero elements to the front and zeros to the back.

#### **Sliding Window Technique**

1. **Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K**
   - **Problem**: Find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size `k`.
   - **Example**: [Sliding Window - Maximum Sum Subarray](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/window-sliding-technique/)
   - **Approach**: Initialize the window with the first `k` elements, slide the window by adding the next element and removing the previous one from the sum.

2. **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**
   - **Problem**: Find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
   - **Example**: [LeetCode 3 - Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)
   - **Approach**: Use a variable sliding window to expand until a duplicate character is found, then move the start of the window to maintain unique characters.

3. **Minimum Window Substring**
   - **Problem**: Given two strings `s` and `t`, find the minimum window in `s` that contains all characters of `t`.
   - **Example**: [LeetCode 76 - Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/)
   - **Approach**: Expand the window until it contains all characters, then contract it to minimize the window size while keeping all required characters.

4. **Find All Anagrams in a String**
   - **Problem**: Find all start indices of `p`'s anagrams in `s`.
   - **Example**: [LeetCode 438 - Find All Anagrams in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/)
   - **Approach**: Use a sliding window of the length of `p`, and a frequency map to check for anagrams as the window slides across `s`.

#### **Frequency Counting Problems**

1. **Longest Substring with K Unique Characters**
   - **Problem**: Find the length of the longest substring that contains exactly `k` unique characters.
   - **Example**: [GeeksforGeeks - Longest Substring with K Unique Characters](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/longest-substring-with-k-unique-characters/)
   - **Approach**: Use a sliding window with a hashmap to keep track of character frequencies.

2. **Check Permutation in String**
   - **Problem**: Given two strings `s1` and `s2`, return true if `s2` contains a permutation of `s1`.
   - **Example**: [LeetCode 567 - Permutation in String](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-in-string/)
   - **Approach**: Use a fixed-size sliding window and frequency counting to compare window content with `s1`.

3. **Character Replacement**
   - **Problem**: Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, find the length of the longest substring that can be obtained by replacing at most `k` characters with any character.
   - **Example**: [LeetCode 424 - Longest Repeating Character Replacement](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-character-replacement/)
   - **Approach**: Use a sliding window with a frequency map to track the count of the most frequent character and determine when to shrink the window.

### **Suggested Problem-Solving Approach**

1. **Understand the Problem**: Read the problem carefully and understand constraints.
2. **Identify Patterns**: Recognize whether the problem can be solved using two-pointer or sliding window techniques.
3. **Outline the Solution**: Sketch the steps, think about edge cases, and visualize how pointers or window adjustments occur.
4. **Code the Solution**: Implement step-by-step, testing at intervals to catch any logic errors.
5. **Optimize and Review**: Once the solution is working, analyze time complexity and consider if improvements are possible.

### **Final Tips**
- For array problems, get comfortable with edge cases like empty arrays, single-element arrays, and arrays with only one type of element (e.g., all zeros).
- For strings, be aware of special cases like case-sensitivity, spaces, and special characters if relevant to the problem.
- Regularly review your solutions and seek alternative approaches (such as using sets for duplicates).
