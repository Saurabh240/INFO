### Week 1: **System Design Basics**
**Day 1-3: Key Concepts**
- **Scalability**: Vertical vs. Horizontal Scaling.
- **Load Balancing**: Types of load balancers, DNS-based vs Application-based.
- **Caching**: Use cases, cache invalidation strategies, and tools (Redis, Memcached).
  
**Day 4: Question 1**
- **Q: Design a URL shortening service like Bit.ly.**
  - **Key concepts**: Hashing, database sharding, key-value store for fast lookups.

**Day 5-7: Database Fundamentals**
- **RDBMS vs NoSQL**: CAP theorem, partitioning, replication, and eventual consistency.
- **Database sharding**: How to shard and partition data.
- **Database replication**: Master-slave, leaderless, and multi-master replication.

### Week 2: **Intermediate Concepts**
**Day 8-10: Design Patterns**
- **Event-driven architecture**: Producer-consumer, event stream processing.
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**: When and how to implement it.
- **Microservices**: Inter-service communication (REST, gRPC), eventual consistency.

**Day 11: Question 2**
- **Q: Design a messaging service like WhatsApp.**
  - **Key concepts**: Message queues (Kafka), data storage (Cassandra), real-time notifications, and scaling.

**Day 12-13: Fault Tolerance**
- **Replication vs Redundancy**: Techniques to ensure uptime.
- **Circuit Breakers**: How to implement a system to prevent cascading failures.
  
**Day 14: Question 3**
- **Q: Design a rate limiter for an API service.**
  - **Key concepts**: Token bucket, sliding window, Redis implementation for distributed rate limiting.

### Week 3: **Advanced Concepts**
**Day 15-16: Distributed Systems**
- **Leader Election**: Paxos, Raft, and consensus algorithms.
- **Data Consistency**: Strong consistency vs eventual consistency.

**Day 17: Question 4**
- **Q: Design a distributed file storage system like Dropbox.**
  - **Key concepts**: File synchronization, conflict resolution, metadata storage, chunking, and deduplication.

**Day 18-19: Security and Authentication**
- **Authentication**: OAuth2, JWT, SSO (Single Sign-On).
- **Encryption**: Data at rest, data in transit, HTTPS, TLS, and SSL.

**Day 20: Question 5**
- **Q: Design an online collaborative document editing service like Google Docs.**
  - **Key concepts**: Conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs), real-time collaboration, distributed consistency.

### Week 4: **Architecting for Scale**
**Day 21-22: High Availability**
- **Disaster Recovery**: Backup strategies, failover mechanisms, multi-region setups.
- **Auto-scaling**: How to handle spikes in traffic.

**Day 23: Question 6**
- **Q: Design a global content delivery network (CDN).**
  - **Key concepts**: Cache servers, geo-location, edge computing, content invalidation.

**Day 24-26: Monitoring and Observability**
- **Logging**: Distributed logging systems (ELK stack, Splunk).
- **Monitoring**: Metrics collection (Prometheus, Grafana), alerting systems.
- **Tracing**: Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry, Jaeger.

**Day 27: Question 7**
- **Q: Design a video streaming service like YouTube.**
  - **Key concepts**: Chunking videos, adaptive bitrate streaming, CDN usage, handling live streaming.

**Day 28-30: Wrap Up**
- **Review**: Revisit the core concepts and design principles.
- **Practice**: Solve additional design problems from platforms like LeetCode, SystemDesignPrimer.
