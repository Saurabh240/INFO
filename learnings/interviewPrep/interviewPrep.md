   - Interfaces and abstract classes
   - Design patterns (Singleton, Factory, Observer, Strategy, etc.)

3. Concurrency and Multithreading:

   - Thread lifecycle and management
   - Synchronization and locks
   - Executors framework and concurrency utilities (e.g., `CountDownLatch`, `CyclicBarrier`, `Semaphore`, `BlockingQueue`)
   - Fork-Join framework

4. Java Memory Management:
   - Garbage collection
   - Memory leaks and how to avoid them
   - JVM tuning and profiling

### Advanced Java

1. Java I/O and NIO:

   - File handling and serialization
   - Streams and readers/writers
   - NIO (Non-blocking I/O), channels, and buffers

2. Java 8 and Beyond:

   - Lambdas and functional interfaces
   - Streams API and parallel streams
   - Optional class
   - New features in Java 9-17 (modules, var, records, sealed classes, etc.)

3. Exception Handling:
   - Checked vs unchecked exceptions
   - Best practices for exception handling

### Frameworks and Libraries

1. Spring Framework:

   - Core concepts (dependency injection, AOP, etc.)
   - Spring Boot and microservices
   - Spring Data JPA, Spring MVC, Spring Security
   - RESTful services with Spring

2. Hibernate and JPA:

   - ORM concepts
   - Entity lifecycle and relationships
   - Querying with JPQL and Criteria API

3. Testing:
   - JUnit and TestNG
   - Mocking frameworks (Mockito, PowerMock)
   - Integration testing with Spring Test

### Web Technologies

1. Web Development:
   - Servlets and JSP
   - RESTful and SOAP web services
   - JSON and XML processing
   - Web security basics

### Microservices and Cloud

1. Microservices Architecture:

   - Principles and best practices
   - Communication patterns (REST, gRPC, messaging)
   - Service discovery and load balancing

2. Cloud Platforms:

   - Basics of cloud computing (AWS, Azure, GCP)
   - Containerization with Docker
   - Orchestration with Kubernetes

3. CI/CD and DevOps:
   - Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipelines
   - Tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, CircleCI
   - Configuration management with Ansible, Chef, Puppet

### Database and Persistence

1. Relational Databases:

   - SQL and database design
   - Transactions and isolation levels
   - Performance tuning and indexing

2. NoSQL Databases:
   - Concepts and use cases (MongoDB, Cassandra, etc.)
   - CAP theorem and trade-offs

### System Design and Architecture

1. System Design Principles:

   - High availability and scalability
   - Load balancing and caching
   - CAP theorem and trade-offs
   - Event-driven architecture

2. Design Patterns:

   - Creational, structural, and behavioral patterns
   - Anti-patterns and best practices

3. Architectural Patterns:
   - Microservices vs monolithic
   - CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
   - Event sourcing

### Soft Skills

1. Problem Solving and Algorithms:

   - Data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs)
   - Algorithms (sorting, searching, dynamic programming)
   - Coding practice on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank

2. Communication and Collaboration:
   - Working in agile teams
   - Code reviews and pair programming
   - Technical documentation and presentation skills

### Additional Areas

1. Performance Tuning and Profiling:

   - JVM tuning
   - Profiling tools (VisualVM, JProfiler)
   - Analyzing and optimizing application performance

2. Security:

   - Understanding of basic security principles
   - Secure coding practices
   - Common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)

3. Build Tools:
   - Maven and Gradle
   - Dependency management and multi-module projects
