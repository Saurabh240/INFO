## 🧠 **DAY 1–2: High-Level System Design (HLD)**

---

### ✅ 1️⃣ **Uber-like Dispatch System Design**

#### 🔹 Key components:

* **Services:** Rider Service, Driver Service, Trip Service, Pricing Service, Notification Service.
* **Core features:** Real-time matching, geo-location tracking, surge pricing.

**💡 Task:**

* Sketch architecture diagram with:

  * API Gateway
  * Service registry (e.g., Eureka/Consul)
  * Kafka for location events and trip updates
  * Redis for driver availability and geohashing

**Discussion points:**

* How to store driver/rider location efficiently (Redis with geospatial index).
* Matching algorithm (proximity + ETA).
* Scaling location updates (Kafka topic partitioning by geohash or city).

---

### ✅ 2️⃣ **Instagram Feed Design**

#### 🔹 Core requirements:

* Personalized feed for users.
* Media storage (images, videos).
* Likes, comments, and stories.

**💡 Task:**

* Describe:

  * Timeline generation strategy (push vs pull models).
  * Caching layer for most recent feed.
  * CDN usage for media.
  * Kafka for async fan-out of posts.

**Discussion points:**

* DB schema for posts, followers, likes.
* Sharding by userId or region.
* Read optimization for large follower networks.

---

### ✅ 3️⃣ **WhatsApp Chat Backend Design**

#### 🔹 Core requirements:

* 1-to-1 and group chat.
* Delivery guarantees.
* End-to-end encryption.

**💡 Task:**

* Discuss:

  * WebSocket vs polling for real-time communication.
  * Kafka usage for decoupled processing (read receipts, archiving).
  * Database modeling for chat messages (partitioning by conversationId).

**Discussion points:**

* How to achieve scale: billions of messages/day.
* Offline user handling and retry.
* Message ordering within chats.

## 🧠 **DAY 3–5: End-to-End Mock Interviews**

---

### ✅ 4️⃣ **Mock Interview 1: Java + DSA**

**💡 Common areas:**

* Streams API, Optional, records, pattern matching.
* Data structures: arrays, strings, maps, sets, recursion.

**Practice tasks:**

* Implement LRU cache using LinkedHashMap.
* Solve:

  * Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
  * Group Anagrams
  * Two Sum with HashMap
  * Sort employees by department then by salary.

---

### ✅ 5️⃣ **Mock Interview 2: Spring Boot + Kafka**

**💡 Topics checklist:**

* REST API best practices.
* Dependency injection principles.
* Profiles, actuator, exception handling.
* Kafka producer/consumer patterns.
* Exactly-once semantics.

**Practice tasks:**

* Design REST API for `/orders` with validation + pagination.
* Kafka consumer for order events with retry + DLQ handling.

---

### ✅ 6️⃣ **Mock Interview 3: System Design**

**💡 Typical systems:**

* URL shortener.
* Rate limiter.
* E-commerce checkout system.
* Order management microservice.

**Discussion checklist:**

* DB schema design.
* Scaling reads/writes.
* Consistency requirements.
* Caching strategy.
* Async processing (Kafka or queues).

---

### ✅ 7️⃣ **Mock Interview 4: HR / Behavioral**

**💡 STAR template prep:**

* Handling production outage.
* Taking ownership of ambiguous requirements.
* Leading team/project successfully.
* Conflict resolution with a teammate or stakeholder.
* Optimizing an existing feature for performance.

---

## 🧠 **DAY 6–7: Resume + GitHub Finalization**

---

### ✅ 8️⃣ **Resume Refinement Checklist:**

🔹 **Structure:**

* Summary: 3-4 lines (skills, years of experience).
* Projects: Brief, achievement-oriented, measurable impact.
* Technologies: Focus on Java, Spring Boot, Kafka, PostgreSQL, system design.

🔹 **Highlight:**

* Performance tuning, scalability achievements.
* Microservices and Kafka use cases.
* Real-world outcomes (e.g., “reduced API response time by 30%”).

---

### ✅ 9️⃣ **GitHub Finalization Checklist:**

🔹 **Repositories:**

* Make key projects public.
* Clear folder structure: `src`, `docs`, `scripts`.

🔹 **README must-have:**

* Project overview.
* Architecture diagram (can attach PNG).
* Setup steps: `mvn spring-boot:run` or Docker instructions.
* Tech stack badges.

🔹 **Optional badges:**

* Build status (`GitHub Actions` / `Travis CI`).
* Code coverage (Codecov, Jacoco badge).

**💡 Task:**

* Ensure `user-service`, `order-service`, and a personal system design project (e.g., `url-shortener`) are polished and documented on GitHub.

## 📝 **Behavioral Prep Focus:**

| **Scenario**                | **STAR Answer Points**                               |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Failure in production       | Root-cause analysis, fix, prevention, communication. |
| Leading feature development | Requirement breakdown, collaboration, delivery.      |
| Performance optimization    | Example: index tuning, caching, code optimization.   |
| Handling conflict           | Empathy + facts-based resolution + positive outcome. |
