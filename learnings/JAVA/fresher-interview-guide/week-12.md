### Week 12: Final Revision + Mock Interviews - Detailed Teaching Guide

---

#### **Day 1–2: Revise Java Basics + OOP + Collections**

**Objective:** Refresh core Java concepts crucial for technical interviews.

**Topics to Revise:**

* Data types, control flow, arrays, strings
* OOP principles (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction)
* `equals()` vs `==`, `hashCode()` contract
* Collections framework: ArrayList, LinkedList, HashMap, HashSet

**Practice:**

* Create a quick notes sheet summarizing each topic
* Implement examples for inheritance, method overriding, `Comparator`
* List key differences: List vs Set, Map vs HashMap

**Tools:** Flashcards, Notion, or Quizlet

#### **Day 3–4: Revise DSA: Arrays, Strings, Hashing**

**Objective:** Reinforce problem-solving using core data structures.

**Topics to Focus:**

* Arrays: Two-pointer problems, sliding window
* Strings: Reversal, palindrome check, longest substring without repeat
* Hashing: Frequency count, hashing with pairs, prefix sums

**Practice:**

* 4–6 problems daily on LeetCode/CodingNinjas
* Time each problem to simulate interview conditions

**Example Problems:**

* Two Sum (HashMap)
* Group Anagrams (HashMap + sorting)
* Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
* Maximum Subarray (Kadane’s Algorithm)

#### **Day 5: Revise Spring Boot Project**

**Objective:** Be confident explaining and navigating your project.

**Checklist:**

* Review API endpoints: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
* Explain the role of each layer: Controller, Service, Repository
* Explain how validations and exceptions work
* Be ready to demo or draw architecture

**Practice:**

* Deploy the project locally and test it
* Add JavaDoc or markdown notes to explain flow
* Prepare to answer: "What challenges did you face and how did you solve them?"

#### **Day 6: Mock Interview (Tech + HR Style)**

**Objective:** Practice real interview flow and receive feedback.

**Structure:**

* 30–45 mins technical (coding + core Java + Spring Boot)
* 15–20 mins HR (behavioral + background + goals)

**Technical Focus:**

* Solve 1 DSA problem (live coding)
* Explain Java OOP + project architecture
* Answer Java-specific questions: memory model, garbage collection, streams

**HR Focus:**

* Tell me about yourself
* Why do you want this role?
* Describe a challenge you overcame

**Tools:** Use Google Meet, Zoom, or Pramp

#### **Day 7: Final Tips & Mental Prep**

**Objective:** Build confidence and prepare mentally for interview day.

**Checklist:**

* Review notes from the past 3 weeks
* Read through mock feedback and improve weak spots
* Sleep well, eat clean, hydrate

**Mindset Tips:**

* Focus on explaining your thought process
* Don’t be afraid to clarify questions
* If stuck, communicate and reason logically

**Prep Tasks:**

* Prepare interview outfit
* Ready your device for virtual interview (audio/video/test code editor)
* Do one final mock if needed with a friend or solo
