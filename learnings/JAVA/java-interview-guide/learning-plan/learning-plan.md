1. **Day 1–3:** Review Java basics
   - Focus on object-oriented principles (e.g., inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction).
   - Understand access modifiers, static vs. instance, and memory management.

2. **Day 4–6:** Java Collections Framework
   - Dive into collections like `ArrayList`, `HashMap`, `HashSet`, `LinkedList`, etc.
   - Understand the internal workings, usage, and time complexity of each.

3. **Day 7–8:** Exception Handling and Multithreading
   - Cover checked vs. unchecked exceptions, custom exceptions, and best practices.
   - Review thread lifecycle, synchronization, and commonly used classes (`ExecutorService`, `Future`, `Callable`).

4. **Day 9–10:** Java 8+ features
   - Focus on Lambdas, Streams, `Optional`, and functional interfaces.
   - Practice basic Stream API tasks like filtering, mapping, and reducing.

---

#### **Week 3–4: Data Structures and Algorithms**
*Goal:* Prepare for problem-solving and algorithm-based questions commonly asked in interviews.

1. **Day 1–2:** Array and String problems
   - Practice simple problems on arrays and strings (e.g., two-pointer techniques, sliding window).

2. **Day 3–4:** Linked Lists and Stacks
   - Understand Linked List traversal and manipulation (reversing, detecting cycles).
   - Review stack operations, including common problems like balanced parentheses.

3. **Day 5–6:** Trees and Graphs
   - Focus on traversals (BFS, DFS), binary search trees, and basic graph concepts.
   - Practice problems on finding height, depth, and paths in trees.

4. **Day 7–8:** Sorting and Searching
   - Review sorting algorithms (merge sort, quick sort) and binary search.
   - Practice problems combining sorting/searching with other data structures.

5. **Day 9–10:** Dynamic Programming (DP)
   - Cover basic DP concepts like memoization and tabulation.
   - Practice 1-2 simple DP problems (e.g., Fibonacci, knapsack) to understand state transitions.

> **Tip:** Use platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or GeeksforGeeks to find problems for each topic. Aim for 1–2 problems daily.

---

#### **Week 5–6: Spring Framework and Microservices**
*Goal:* Build on your Spring Boot experience to cover key topics like dependency injection, AOP, Spring Data JPA, and RESTful services.

1. **Day 1–2:** Spring Core (Dependency Injection and Beans)
   - Review DI concepts, bean scopes, and bean lifecycle.
   - Understand configuration options (Java-based, annotations, XML).

2. **Day 3–4:** Spring Boot
   - Review key annotations (`@SpringBootApplication`, `@RestController`, etc.).
   - Cover configuration management with `application.properties` and `application.yml`.

3. **Day 5–6:** Spring Data JPA and Hibernate
   - Understand JPA fundamentals, repositories, and query methods.
   - Practice writing JPQL and criteria queries.

4. **Day 7–8:** RESTful APIs with Spring Boot
   - Design a simple CRUD API with Spring Boot.
   - Review HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and status codes.

5. **Day 9–10:** Microservices basics
   - Understand microservices concepts (e.g., service discovery, load balancing, resilience).
   - Review Spring Cloud basics like `Eureka`, `Feign`, and `Hystrix` (if relevant to your projects).

---

#### **Week 7: Database Management and SQL**
*Goal:* Refresh SQL skills and understand how to optimize queries.

1. **Day 1–2:** Basic SQL Queries
   - Review essential operations like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, JOIN, and GROUP BY.

2. **Day 3–4:** Advanced SQL Topics
   - Cover window functions, subqueries, and complex joins.
   - Practice optimization tips like indexing and query profiling.

3. **Day 5–6:** Transactions and Isolation Levels
   - Understand ACID properties, transaction management, and isolation levels in databases.
   - Review how Spring handles transactions using `@Transactional`.

4. **Day 7:** NoSQL (Optional, if relevant)
   - Understand basics of NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB) and when to use them over SQL databases.

---

#### **Week 8: System Design Basics and Mock Interviews**
*Goal:* Gain a basic understanding of system design and improve your interview skills with mock sessions.

1. **Day 1–3:** System Design Basics
   - Cover basics of load balancing, caching, database partitioning, and horizontal vs. vertical scaling.
   - Review some basic design patterns like Singleton, Factory, and Observer.

2. **Day 4–5:** High-level system design
   - Design simple systems (e.g., URL shortener, file storage, social media feed) and outline components.
   - Focus on breaking down a system into services and choosing appropriate databases and communication protocols.

3. **Day 6–7:** Mock Interviews and Review
   - Conduct a few mock interviews with a friend or mentor.
   - Review key concepts and revisit any weak areas.

### Additional Tips
- **Focus on Problem-Solving Skills**: Practice is key to acing technical rounds, especially for product-based roles.
- **Mock Interviews**: Schedule these periodically, especially in the last two weeks, to simulate the interview experience.
- **Resources**: Consider books like *Effective Java* by Joshua Bloch, *Java Concurrency in Practice*, and *Cracking the Coding Interview* by Gayle Laakmann McDowell.
- **System Design Knowledge**: While this may not be essential for service-based roles, it is increasingly expected in product-based company interviews.

Let me know if you’d like more detail on any specific week or topic!To prepare for a Java Developer interview for both service and product-based companies, it’s essential to build a strong foundation in Java fundamentals, dive into key frameworks like Spring Boot, practice problem-solving, and be comfortable with system design. Given your 6+ years of experience and limited time (1 hour per day), the following plan balances key topics in Java, Spring ecosystem, databases, system design, and interview problem-solving.
