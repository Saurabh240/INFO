**Q-1: What is GraphQL?**  
**A:** GraphQL is a query language for APIs that allows clients to request specific data from a server. Unlike REST APIs, which have multiple endpoints for different resources, GraphQL provides a single endpoint and allows clients to query exactly the data they need, making data fetching more efficient and flexible.

---

**Q-2: How does GraphQL differ from REST?**  
**A:** GraphQL differs from REST in several ways:

- **Single Endpoint:** GraphQL uses a single endpoint for all data queries and mutations, whereas REST uses multiple endpoints.
- **Flexible Data Retrieval:** GraphQL allows clients to request only the data they need, avoiding over-fetching or under-fetching of data.
- **Strong Typing:** GraphQL schemas are strongly typed, providing a clear contract between client and server.

---

**Q-3: What are the core components of a GraphQL schema?**  
**A:** The core components of a GraphQL schema include:

- **Types:** Define the structure of data (e.g., `Query`, `Mutation`, `Subscription`).
- **Fields:** Specify the data that can be fetched or modified.
- **Resolvers:** Functions that handle data fetching for each field.

---

**Q-4: Can you explain the purpose of a resolver in GraphQL?**  
**A:** Resolvers are functions that handle the fetching of data for a specific field in a GraphQL query. They connect to databases or other services to retrieve the requested data and return it to the client.

---

**Q-5: How do you handle authentication and authorization in GraphQL?**  
**A:** Authentication and authorization in GraphQL can be handled by:

- Using middleware to verify authentication tokens.
- Implementing custom directives for authorization.
- Integrating with existing authentication systems.

---

**Q-6: What is the difference between a query and a mutation in GraphQL?**  
**A:** Queries are used to fetch data from the server, while mutations are used to create, update, or delete data on the server.

---

**Q-7: How do you handle errors in GraphQL?**  
**A:** GraphQL handles errors by including them in the response body. Custom error messages can be provided in resolvers or middleware to inform clients about issues.

---

**Q-8: What is a GraphQL subscription, and how is it used?**  
**A:** A GraphQL subscription allows clients to maintain a real-time connection with the server to receive updates when data changes. It is used for real-time features like notifications or live data updates.

---

**Q-9: Can you describe the concept of schema stitching or schema federation?**  
**A:** Schema stitching and federation are methods to combine multiple GraphQL schemas into a single unified schema. This allows for modular development and easier integration of services by merging different schemas.

---

**Q-10: How do you implement pagination in GraphQL?**  
**A:** Pagination in GraphQL can be implemented using:

- **Cursor-based Pagination:** Uses `first`, `after`, `last`, and `before` arguments to navigate through data.
- **Offset-based Pagination:** Uses `limit` and `offset` arguments to control data retrieval.

---

**Q-11: What are GraphQL fragments, and how are they used?**  
**A:** GraphQL fragments are reusable units of a query that allow for the sharing of common fields across multiple queries. They help to avoid duplication and maintain consistency in queries.

---

**Q-12: How do you optimize the performance of a GraphQL server?**  
**A:** Performance optimization can be achieved by:

- Using query batching to reduce the number of requests.
- Implementing caching to store frequently accessed data.
- Employing data loader libraries to batch and cache database requests.

---

**Q-13: What tools or libraries have you used for GraphQL development?**  
**A:** Common tools and libraries include:

- **Apollo Server** and **Apollo Client** for building and consuming GraphQL APIs.
- **GraphiQL** for interactive GraphQL queries.
- **Relay** for managing data in React applications.

---

**Q-14: Can you explain the purpose of the `@include` and `@skip` directives in GraphQL?**  
**A:** The `@include` and `@skip` directives are used to conditionally include or exclude fields in a query based on variables. `@include(if: Boolean)` includes the field if the condition is true, while `@skip(if: Boolean)` excludes the field if the condition is true.

---

**Q-15: How do you test GraphQL queries and mutations?**  
**A:** Testing GraphQL queries and mutations can be done using tools like Jest with Apollo or by writing integration tests to verify the behavior of GraphQL endpoints. Tests should cover various scenarios to ensure correct functionality.
