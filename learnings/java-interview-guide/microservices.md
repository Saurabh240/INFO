# Monolithic Applications vs Microservices

## 1. What is a Monolithic Application?

A monolithic application is a software design where different modules are integrated into a single application or codebase. For example, a hospital management system might include:

- **Patient Registration Module**: Captures patient details.
- **Clinical Module**: Handles diagnostic information like X-rays and blood tests.
- **Bed Management Module**: Manages inpatient beds.
- **Claim Management Module**: Handles insurance claims.

### Characteristics

- **Single Codebase**: All modules are combined into one application.
- **Challenges**:
  - **Maintenance**: Fixing bugs or adding new features requires careful handling to avoid impacting other modules.
  - **Deployment**: Updating the application necessitates redeploying the entire codebase, affecting all modules.

As the application grows, managing and evolving a monolithic codebase becomes increasingly complex.

## 2. What are Microservices?

Microservices are a design approach where an application is divided into smaller, independent services that each address a specific business function. For instance, the monolithic hospital management system can be split into:

- **Patient Registration Microservice**: Manages patient details.
- **Clinical Microservice**: Handles diagnostic information.
- **Bed Management Microservice**: Manages patient beds.
- **Claim Management Microservice**: Handles insurance claims.

### Characteristics

- **Business-Defined Boundaries**: Each microservice solves a specific business problem.
- **Autonomy**: Microservices are self-contained and can be built, deployed, and scaled independently.
- **Communication**: Microservices interact through APIs or other network calls.
- **Deployment**: Services can be changed or deployed without affecting other services.

To qualify as a microservice, an application should be able to change and deploy independently without impacting other services.

## 3. Why Microservices?

Microservices offer several advantages over monolithic architectures:

- **Heterogeneity**: Services can be developed in different programming languages and deployed on various operating systems.
- **Robustness**: Failure of one microservice does not impact the others, enhancing system resilience.
- **Scalability**: Stateless design allows for easy scaling by deploying multiple instances of a service.
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Changes can be made to individual services without redeploying the entire application, leading to faster time-to-production.
- **Reusability**: Microservices can be reused across different applications and easily replaced if necessary.

## 4. REST vs Messaging

Choosing between REST and messaging for inter-service communication depends on the use case:

- **REST**:

  - **Use Case**: Synchronous request-response scenarios.
  - **Protocol**: HTTP, which is straightforward to implement and ideal for external-facing APIs.
  - **Benefits**: Simplicity and ease of development for external interactions.

- **Messaging**:
  - **Use Case**: Asynchronous communication, especially for non-blocking applications.
  - **Reliability**: Messages can be persisted and are less likely to be lost.
  - **Benefits**: Suitable for internal communication within an organization and handling high-volume data exchanges.

Both methods can be used together depending on the requirements of the microservices architecture.
